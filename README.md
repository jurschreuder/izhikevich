# Izhikevich neuron in c++

This is some c++ code to simulate Izhikevich spiking neurons, from the paper:

[https://www.izhikevich.org/publications/spikes.htm](paper)

## How to run it

For easier building there is a docker image

#### Build the docker:

```docker build -t izhi .```

#### Start the docker interactively with this (project) folder shared under `/izhi` for easy development:

```docker run --name izhi -v `pwd`:/izhi -it izhi /bin/bash```

(I dont know how `pwd` works on windows, but it's the absolute path to this folder on your computer)

#### Build the source code (in the interactive docker):
```
cd /izhi
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./izhikevich
```

Output image will be in `output/out.jpg`


#### Some presets

```
Regular spiking:
./izhikevich 0.02 0.2 -65 8

Intrinsically bursting:
./izhikevich 0.02 0.2 -55 4

Chattering:
./izhikevich 0.02 0.2 -50 2

Fast spiking:
./izhikevich 0.1 0.2 -65 2

Thalamo-cortical:
./izhikevich 0.02 0.25 -65 0.05

Resonator:
./izhikevich 0.1 0.26 -65 2

Low-threshold spiking:
./izhikevich 0.02 0.25 -65 2
